          Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell was born in Los Angeles,
          California on December 18, 2001. She is the daughter of teacher,
          actress, and screenwriter Maggie Baird, and construction worker
          Patrick O'Connell, who worked part-time as an actor, appearing in
          films like Iron Man (2008). Both her parents are amateur musicians.
          She is of Irish and Scottish descent. The singer's middle name,
          Eilish, was originally meant to be her first name, while Pirate
          (proposed by her brother Finneas, four years her senior) was to be her
          middle name. She was conceived via in vitro fertilization. She was
          brought up in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. While she
          was homeschooled, her mother taught her and Finneas the basics of
          songwriting.O'Connell and her brother had worked together on some
          music, while he had been writing and producing his own songs and
          performing with his band. O'Connell said her brother and her mother
          inspired her to get into music. Their parents encouraged the siblings
          to express themselves and explore whatever they wanted, including art,
          dancing, and acting. O'Connell wrote her first "real" song at age 11
          for her mother's songwriting class. The song is about the zombie
          apocalypse, inspired by the television series The Walking Dead from
          which she took script lines and episode titles that she added to the
          song as part of the assignment.[19][18] O'Connell had gone on some
          acting auditions, which she disliked; however, she enjoyed recording
          background dialogue for crowd scenes and worked on the films Diary of
          a Wimpy Kid, Ramona and Beezus, and the X-Men series.She performed at
          talent shows and joined the Los Angeles Children's Chorus at age
          eight.

         <strong> 2015â€“2017: Don't Smile at Me Mainarticle: Don't Smile at Me Eilish</strong> 
          <br />Performing in August 2017 In 2015, 13-year-old Eilish began working on
          songs with her brother, Finneas O'Connell, who had been writing and
          producing for several years and had his own band. The first songs they
          recorded together were called "She's Broken" and "Fingers Crossed".
          "The first songs that we worked on, we didn't write together. He wrote
          this song called 'She's Broken' and I wrote one called 'Fingers
          Crossed,' and we recorded them and put them out on SoundCloud, just
          for fun," she recalls. On November 18, 2015, Eilish released the
          song "Ocean Eyes". The track was written, mixed, and produced by
          Finneas, who had written and produced it originally for his band the
          Slightlys, before realizing it would be a better fit for Eilish's
          vocals. He gave it to Eilish when her dance teacher at
          the Revolution Dance Center, Fred Diaz, asked them to write a song for
          choreography. The siblings uploaded the song to SoundCloud, where Diaz
          could access and download it. The song received
          several hundred thousand listens in two weeks, and Finneas's manager,
          Danny Rukasin, reached out to him to discuss Eilish's potential. In
          Rukasin's opinion, she could achieve significant success with
          Finneas's help. In January 2016, Finneas and his manager arranged
          a deal in which Apple Music signed Eilish to AR company Platoon,
          specializing in packaging emerging artists before they get a
          major-label contract. Eilish then got a publicist, who
          connected her to the luxury fashion brand Chanel, and a stylist, both
          of whom helped shape her image. On March 24, 2016, a music video
          for "Ocean Eyes" directed by Megan Thompson was premiered on Eilish's
          official YouTube channel. "Ocean Eyes" and Eilish would receive
          praise and promotion from various media outlets and marketers,
          including radio stations and music supervisors such as Beats 1, KCRW,
          BBC One, Zane Lowe, Jason Kramer, Annie Mac, and Chris Douridas.
          On June 23, 2016, Eilish and Finneas released "Six Feet Under" through
          SoundCloud as her second single. A homemade music video for the
          song was released on June 30, 2016.It was directed by Eilish and
          edited by her mother, Maggie Baird. In August 2016, Justin
          Lubliner, who had noticed Eilish's talent back in 2015 when he first
          heard "Ocean Eyes", signed her to Darkroom and Interscope
          Records. He developed her rollout as an artist, taking
          inspiration from the model of hip hop artists such as Travis Scott and
          Chance the Rapper, not relying on one big single and focusing on
          creating a "persona and distinct aesthetic". Darkroom and
          Interscope Records re-released "Six Feet Under" and "Ocean Eyes" as
          singles for digital download and streaming on November 17 and 18,
          2016, respectively. On November 22, 2016, a dance performance
          music video for "Ocean Eyes" was uploaded to Eilish's YouTube
          channel. On January 14, 2017, Eilish released an EP with four
          remixes by Astronomyy, Blackbear, Goldhouse, and Cautious Clay for
          "Ocean Eyes", and released another EP for "Six Feet Under"
          featuring remixes by Blu J, Gazzo, Jerry Folk, and Aire Atlantica.
          Following the success of the "Ocean Eyes" remixes, Eilish released
          "Bellyache" on February 24, 2017, A music video for the song was
          released on March 22, 2017, and was directed by Miles and AJ
          Eilish later released "Bored" on March 30, 2017, as part of the
          soundtrack to the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why. A music video for
          "Bored" was later released on June 26, 2017.In March of the same
          year, Apple Music showcased Eilish at the South by Southwest music
          festival. On June 30, 2017, Eilish released "Watch".
          Eilish later released another single, "Copycat", which was released on
          July 14, 2017,[48] and announced the release of her debut EP, Don't
          Smile at Me.[49] Eilish later released "Idontwannabeyouanymore" and
          "My Boy". On August 11, 2017, Eilish released Don't Smile at
          Me. The EP was a sleeper hit, reaching number 14 on the US
          Billboard 200. Eilish embarked on the Don't Smile at Me Tour
          throughout October 2017 in support of her EP. Eilish released
          "Bitches Broken Hearts" through SoundCloud on November 10,
          2017.[55][56][57][58] Eilish's team worked with Spotify, which
          promoted her on its most popular playlist, "Today's Top Hits".[8] The
          Baffler described Eilish's sound as fitting into the "streambait"
          genre consisting of largely "mid-tempo, melancholy pop" influenced by
          Lana Del Rey, whose "singing style, bleakness, and the hip-hop
          influenced production" shaped the aesthetic. Eilish's
          commercial success expanded with her Spotify promotion. In
          September 2017, Apple Music named Eilish their Up Next artist, which
          followed with a short documentary, a live session EP and an interview
          with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's radio station Beats 1. That month,
          the live EP titled Up Next Session: Billie Eilish was released. On
          December 15, 2017, Eilish released her collaboration with American
          rapper Vince Staples titled "Burn", which is a remix of Eilish's
          previously released single "Watch". It was later included on the
          expanded edition of Don't Smile at Me.
